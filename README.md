j3270Server ![TESTING WORKFLOW](https://github.com/HealPoint/j3270Server/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)
==============
This library is based on the library created by [racingmars (Matthew R. Wilson)](https://github.com/racingmars/).
Thank you for creating such a great library ❤️

The library is used to write java socket serrver for telnet 3270 clients by building 3270 data streams from fields and processing the response entered by users.

**The library is incomplete**

Everything I know about 3270 datastreams I learned by reading the library [GO3270](https://github.com/racingmars/go3270) and going 
through the tutorial by [Tommy Sprinkle]( http://www.tommysprinkle.com/mvs/P3270/)
